# Deployment
This is the deployment branch! This branch's file is the results of the "npm run build" command in the main branch (that created the compiled app files in the "dist" folder) and 2 functionnal necessary files for Heroku :
- index.php
- composer.json

These 2 files are necessary for the Heroku deployment and the static serving of the webpage. They were added after the "npm run build" command.
This branch is directly linked with Heroku and has *Automatic* deployment enabled
